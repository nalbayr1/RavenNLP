Marshawn Lynch, born April 22, 1986, is a former American football running back known for his 12 seasons in the NFL, primarily with the Seattle Seahawks. Nicknamed "Beast Mode," Lynch was celebrated for his powerful running style. He played college football at the University of California, where he became the school’s second all-time leading rusher and earned first-team All-American honors. Drafted 12th overall by the Buffalo Bills in 2007, Lynch joined the Seahawks in 2010, helping them secure their first Super Bowl title in 2013.
During his career, Lynch was a five-time Pro Bowler and twice led the NFL in rushing touchdowns. His "Beast Quake" run, a 67-yard touchdown in the 2010-11 playoffs, is iconic for breaking multiple tackles. Lynch retired in 2015, returned to play for the Oakland Raiders in 2017, and made a brief comeback with the Seahawks in 2019.
Beyond football, Lynch has invested in sports teams, co-owning the Seattle Kraken (NHL) and Bay Area Panthers (IFL). Known for his reluctance to speak to the media, he famously responded with "I’m just here so I won’t get fined" during a Super Bowl media day. Lynch has also been active in entrepreneurship, with ventures including his Beast Mode brand and a cannabis line, and supports community work through his Fam1st Family Foundation. He’s appeared in various media, from TV shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine to movies like Bottoms and has been involved in the ownership of Fan Controlled Football teams.
